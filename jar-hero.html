                            <h3>Overview</h3>
                            <p>Jar Hero is a branching decision-based story game in which every decision hinges on
                                whether you choose to either loosen or tighten a jar (or bottle or door). This game
                                works with a custom created controller that looks and feels like a jar. The controller
                                also houses team-made electronic sensors built to fit within our space constraints that
                                are capable of interfacing with an Arduino. This in turn was used to send user decision
                                input to a Java-based game created in Processing.</p>
                            <h3>Tools Used</h3>
                            <p>Arduino Coding | IO Sensor Wiring and Hookups | Processing/Java | Code Architecture
                                Planning | 3D Printing | Waterjet</p>
                            <h3>Team</h3>
                            <p>The entire project was completed as a team of three students for an Interactive Product
                                Development class. Two Industrial Design students (Glover Beasley and John Lane)
                                conducted the physical object building and the story creation, while I coded the
                                project.</p>
                            <p><strong>My role: </strong>Coding for both Arduino and Processing. This code had to
                                interface with the graphics designed by another team member, as well as the physical
                                electronics built by the 3rd team member.</p>
                            <p><strong>Project timeframe: </strong> 2 months</p>
                            <h2>Game and Graphic Design</h2>
                            <h3>Game Mechanics</h3>
                            <p>Jar Hero is a branching decision-based story game in which every decision hinges on
                                whether the player chooses to either loosen or tighten the jar-shaped controller that is
                                in front of them.</p>
                            <h3>Coding</h3>
                            <p>I coded the game using Processing, a Java-based IDE built specifically for working with
                                graphics. I also coded the Arduino to read sensor input, and passed it to the game in
                                Processing using the serial and COM libraries.</p>

                            <h3>Graphic Design</h3>
                            <p>Here are some screen captures from gameplay. Illustrations were done for each of the 11
                                characters and 12 decision screens. To keep the player's attention, scrolling text was
                                used in place of animations.</p>

                            <h2>Hardware Design</h2>
                            <p>Inner controller mechanics and haptics included a vibration motor, an Arduino, and custom
                                copper connection detectors.</p>
                            <div class="article-body-img-container"><img src="./case-study-images/jh-schematic.jpg"
                                    alt="Jar Hero Console" style="width: 60%; height: auto;"></div>
                            <p>The Jar Hero game console was made of CNC'd wood and waterjet steel. The jar controller
                                (in blue) was 3D printed and able to be twisted in two directions and then snap back to
                                its original position with a torsion spring.</p>

                            <h2>Learnings</h2>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Custom sensors made of copper tape have much more noise in their IO readings than
                                        professionally made devices. In order to get around this noise, specialized
                                        Arduino commands had to be used on the backend to clean the inbound data.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>When using Java, create as many Objects and Children as possible. This helps
                                        architect the code as well as helps make it easier to read later.</p>
                                </li>
